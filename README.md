# ggplot
Examples of the power of ggplot2 in R programming.

# Time Series ggplots with missing data.R
Illustrates time series while highlighting missing observations.  
The code illstrates how to format x-axis Date, set axis labels, indicate missing values by using "annotate", post adjust overall theme of ggplot and how to plot multiple graphs in a single window with a main title. 

# Heat Maps in ggplot
Illustrates correlations between variables using color intensities via geom_tile function.
The code illstrates how to set and format colour gradient for heat maps in ggplots, present clear plot with no grid lines or box border, how to include text within ggplot, post adjust overall theme of ggplot and how to plot multiple graphs in a single window with a main title.
